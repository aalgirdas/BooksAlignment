# BooksAlignment

This project has a purpose to present bilingual books alignment methods for English - Lithuanian language pair.
In recent years, there have been several proposals to align bilingual corpus and extract translation memory from legal and technical documents. Yet, when it comes to an alignment of corpus of translated fiction and non-fiction books, the existing alignment algorithms give low precision results. In order to solve this low precision  problem, we propose a new method that  incorporates existing alignment algorithms with proactive learning approach.

This method is presented in our  research paper: "Sentence level alignment of digitized books parallel corpora" (currently it is under review).
