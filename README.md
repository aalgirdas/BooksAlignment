This project has a purpose to present bilingual books alignment methods for English - Lithuanian language pair.
In recent years, there have been several proposals to align bilingual corpus and extract translation memory from legal and technical documents. Yet, when it comes to an alignment of corpus of translated fiction and non-fiction books, the existing alignment algorithms give low precision results. In order to solve this low precision  problem, we propose a new method that  incorporates existing alignment algorithms with proactive learning approach.

This method is presented in our  research paper: 
Laukaitis, A., Plikynas, D., & Ostasius, E. (2018). Sentence Level Alignment of Digitized Books Parallel Corpora. Informatica, 29(4), 693-710.

At the current moment, we provide three sets of resources.
In the direcories EN_BOOKS and LT_BOOKS we have selected some books that are copyright free. Anyone can try to align these books and compare the alignment results with the benchmark alignments presented in the directory Alignments.

The alignment results in the directory Alignments can be used as translation memory in computer-aided translation systems.
You can download them on you computer or you can view them  in a browser with (htmlpreview.github.io).
